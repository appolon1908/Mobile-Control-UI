# Mobile-Control-UI — Architecture Charts

> Repository: `appolon1908/Mobile-Control-UI`  
> Baseline branch: `main`  
> Purpose: repository-local visual architecture. These charts describe the intended ownership boundary and should be updated with code changes.

## 1. System context

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A["Operator browser"] --> B["Mobile control UI"]
  B --> C["Mobile-Control-UI<br/>Operator UI for mobile control"]
  C --> D["client/session state"]
  C --> E["Mobile Control Server"]
```

## 2. Internal component architecture

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  IN["Entrypoint / API / CLI"] --> AUTH["Authentication, policy and validation"]
  AUTH --> DOMAIN["Core domain / orchestration"]
  DOMAIN --> STATE["Persistence / configuration / state"]
  DOMAIN --> ADAPTER["Adapters and integrations"]
  ADAPTER --> DEPS["Approved external dependencies"]
  DOMAIN --> OBS["Metrics, logs, traces and audit"]
```

## 3. Critical runtime flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Caller
  participant Boundary as Mobile-Control-UI
  participant Policy as Auth/Policy
  participant Core as Domain/Core
  participant State as State/Store
  participant Dep as Dependency
  Caller->>Boundary: Request / event / command
  Boundary->>Policy: Validate identity + input
  Policy-->>Boundary: Allowed / denied
  Boundary->>Core: Execute Operator action, API request and device-state rendering flow
  Core->>State: Persist or read state
  Core->>Dep: Bounded integration call
  Dep-->>Core: Result / readback
  Core-->>Caller: Normalized response
```

## 4. Deployment and promotion

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  DEV["Feature branch"] --> TEST["Unit / contract / static tests"]
  TEST --> PR["Pull request + review"]
  PR --> CI["Required CI green"]
  CI --> STAGE["Staging / isolated verification"]
  STAGE --> CERT["Exact-SHA certification"]
  CERT --> APPROVAL{"Production approval?"}
  APPROVAL -- "No" --> STAGE
  APPROVAL -- "Yes" --> PROD["Production promotion"]
  PROD --> VERIFY["Health, readiness, metrics and rollback check"]
```

## 5. Observability and recovery

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  R["Mobile-Control-UI runtime"] --> M["Metrics"]
  R --> L["Logs / audit"]
  R --> T["Traces / correlation"]
  M --> O["Observability stack"]
  L --> O
  T --> O
  O --> A["Alerts / dashboards"]
  R --> B["Backup / configuration snapshot"]
  B --> REC["Restore / rollback rehearsal"]
```

## Architecture ownership

- **Repository role:** Operator UI for mobile control
- **Primary boundary:** Mobile control UI
- **State/configuration:** client/session state
- **Downstream/consumers:** Mobile Control Server
- Cross-repository effects must use approved contracts; do not create hidden direct-write paths.
- Production effects remain separately gated and are not authorized by this document.
